https://kubedemy.io/kubernetes-installation-methods-the-complete-guide-update-2022  ### Type of installation

1- Single-node installation:

2- Manual cluster installation:
This type of installation is used for deploying a minimum viable cluster. Some parts of the installation should be done manually. It’s a preferred way to deploy the Kubernetes cluster for the first time.

kubeadm is a tool used to deploy a cluster manually. It is used to bootstrap Kubernetes components, not provisioning machines. Before bootstrapping the cluster, some actions should be done manually.

Automatic mode 

Managed clusters:
Magnum is an OpenStack solution for installing managed Kubernetes – and other orchestration tools – on top of the OpenStack ecosystem. With Magnum, cloud customers can run Kubernetes clusters quickly. I decided to introduce it here because it also supports fantastic cloud features. In addition, OpenStack-based cloud providers can provide this method to their customers to install managed Kubernetes clusters.

AKS is managed by Microsoft Azure and can be deployed quickly. This managed Kubernetes




What is the work of a kube-scheduler?
Kube-scheduler is the default scheduler for Kubernetes. It assigns nodes to newly created pods.

Define daemon sets
Daemon sets are a set of pods that runs on a host. They are used for host layers attributes like monitoring network or simple network.

Define Heapster in Kubernetes
A Heapster is a metrics collection and performance monitoring system for data that are collected by the Kublet.

What tasks are performed by Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is the Linux kernel which is used for distributed systems. It helps you to be abstract the underlying hardware of the nodes(servers) and offers a consistent interface for applications that consume the shared pool of resources.

Define Kubernetes controller manager
The controller manager is a daemon used for garbage collection, core control loops, and namespace creation. It enables the running of more than one process on the master node.

Why use namespace in Kubernetes?
Namespaces in Kubernetes are used for dividing cluster resources between users. It helps the environment where more than one user spread projects or teams and provides a scope of resources.

What are the features of Kubernetes?
The features of Kubernetes are:

Automated Scheduling
Self-Healing Capabilities
Automated rollouts & rollback
Horizontal Scaling & Load Balancing
Offers environment consistency for development, testing, and production
Infrastructure is loosely coupled to each component can act as a separate unit
Provides a higher density of resource utilization
Offers enterprise-ready features
Application-centric management
Auto-scalable infrastructure
You can create predictable infrastructure

Mention the types of controller managers
Types of controller managers are: 1) endpoints controller, 2) service accounts controller, 3) node controller, 4) namespace controller, 5) replication controller, 6) token controller.

Master Node: The master node is the first and most vital component which is responsible for the management of Kubernetes cluster. It is the entry point for all kinds of administrative tasks. There may be more than one master node in the cluster to check for fault tolerance.
API Server: The API server acts as an entry point for all the REST commands used for controlling the cluster.
Scheduler: The scheduler schedules the tasks to the slave node. It stores the resource usage information for every slave node. It is responsible for distributing the workload.
Etcd: etcd components, store configuration detail, and wright values. It communicates with the most component to receive commands and work. It also manages network rules and port forwarding activity.
Worker/Slave nodes: Worker nodes are another essential component that contains all the required services to manage the networking between the containers, communicate with the master node, which allows you to assign resources to the scheduled containers.
Kubelet: It gets the configuration of a Pod from the API server and ensures that the described containers are up and running.
Docker Container: Docker container runs on each of the worker nodes, which runs the configured pods.
Pods: A pod is a combination of single or multiple containers that logically run together on nodes.


List various services available in Kubernetes
Various services available in Kubernetes are 1) Cluster IP service, 2) Load Balancer service, 3) Node Port service, 4) External Name Creation service.

Define Cluster IP
The Cluster IP is a Kubernetes service that offers a service inside the cluster that other apps inside cluster can access.


Explain node port
The node port service is a fundamental way to get external traffic to your service. It opens a particular port on all nodes and forwards network traffic sent to this port.

Define kubelet
The kubelet is a service agent which controls and maintains group pf pods by checking pod specification using Kubernetes. The kubelet runs on each node and allows to communicate between a master node and a slave node.

What are the disadvantages of Kubernetes?
Kubernetes dashboard is not as helpful as it should be
Security is not very effective.
It is very complex and can reduce productivity
Kubernetes is more costly than its alternatives.

Define Ingress Network
Ingress network is defined as a collection of rules which allow permission for connections into the Kubernetes cluster.

What are the tools that are used for container monitoring?
Tools that are used for container monitoring are:

Heapster
cAdvisor
Prometheus
InfluxDB
Grafana

Define headless service
Headless service is defined as a service that uses IP address, but instead of load balancing, it returns of associated pods.

What are the important components of node status?
The important component of node status are:

Condition
Capacity
Info
Address










1. master

These components are the API server, etcd, scheduler, controller-manager, and cloud controller manager.

the controller manager. This component is a single binary composed of four sub-processes and they are:

The node controller: Responsible for the health of the nodes in the cluster.
The replication controller: responsible for keeping the desired amount of pods for each replication.
The endpoints controller: handles the Endpoints object that links services and pods.
The service account and token controller: handles the default accounts and API access for namespaces.




2. Client nodes

kubelet, kubeproxy,container runtime

The kubelet, which makes sure all containers are running and healthy.

The proxy allows communication to the inside network of the cluster by using network rules, mainly used for development and testing pods, it is recommended to remove it in production for security reasons.

The container runtime, which is responsible for running the containers, the most common runtimes choices are: Docker and Containerd


3. Namespaces are a way to organize clusters into virtual sub-clusters — they can be helpful when different teams or projects share a Kubernetes cluster. Any number of namespaces are supported within a cluster, each logically
 separated from others but with the ability to communicate with each other.

A Kubernetes namespace provides the scope for Pods, Services, and Deployments in the cluster. Users interacting with one namespace do not see the content in another namespace

Kubernetes starts with four initial namespaces:
default The default namespace for objects with no other namespace.
kube-node-lease This namespace holds Lease objects associated with each node. ...
kube-public This namespace is created automatically and is readable by all users (including those not authenticated).

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Default: Namespace for objects without any other object.

Kube-node-lease: It holds a lease object which is associated with all nodes.

Kube-public: It is created automatically and can be readable by both authenticated and unauthenticated users.

Kube-system: It is created by the system of Kubernetes.
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


4. Types of Kubernetes Services (networking for pods)
ClusterIP. (ClusterIP (default))Exposes a service which is only accessible from within the cluster.
NodePort. Exposes a service via a static port on each node's IP.
LoadBalancer. Exposes the service via the cloud provider's load balancer.
ExternalName.

Here are important aspects of the service manifest:

metadata:name—this is the logical name of the service, which will also become the DNS name of the service when it is created.
spec:selector—the selector identifies which pods that should be included in the service. In this example, pods that have the label app: nginx will become part of the service.
spec:ports—a list of port configurations (there can be one or more). Each port configuration defines a network protocol and port number. Optionally, the port configuration can define a targetPort, which is the port the pod should send traffic to.

5. A Kubernetes Deployment tells Kubernetes how to create or modify instances of the pods that hold a containerized application. Deployments can help to efficiently scale the number of replica pods, enable the rollout of updated code in a
 controlled manner, or roll back to an earlier deployment version if necessary.

6. A pod is a unit including one or more containers that share storage and networking resources. Pods are the smallest application building blocks in a Kubernetes cluster.

7. A StatefulSet is a workload API object for managing stateful applications.imilar to Deployments, StatefulSets manage the behavior of pods.
 However, it differs from deployments in that it maintains a static ID for each pod. Pods are created from the same template, but each one has a separate identity,
 making it possible to maintain a persistent state across the full lifecycle of the pod.

Deployment	                                   StatefulSet
Intended for stateless applications	          Intended for stateful applications
Pods are interchangeable	                  Pods are unique and have a persistent ID
All replicas share the same volumes and PersistentVolumeClaims	Each pod has its own volumes and PersistentVolumeClaims

8. A ReplicaSet is a Kubernetes object that runs multiple instances of a pod and ensures a certain number of pods is running at all times. 
The goal is to ensure that the applications running in the pods have enough resources and do not experience downtime, even if one or more pods fail. 

9. Kubernetes Deployment Status and Lifecycle
A Kubernetes Deployment object has the following lifecycle stages:

Progressing—this means the Deployment is currently making changes to the cluster to meet the desired state in the declarative configuration.
Completed—this means the deployment has finished matching cluster state to the desired state. All required pods are available and running the latest pods specification, and old pods are no longer running.
Failed—this means that the deployment encountered a problem while trying to reconcile cluster state with desired state. For example, there may have been insufficient resources or errors when running pods. 
To understand the cause of a failed deployment, use the command kubectl rollout status.

10. Kubernetes offers the following two deployment strategies out of the box:
10A.Recreate Deployment

The recreate strategy kills the currently running pod instances and creates new instances running the latest version. This is often used in development environments where users are not actively working on the instances and downtime is acceptable. 

10B. Rolling Update Deployment
Rolling Update Deployment
A rolling update deployment strategy allows for a sequential, gradual transition from one application version to another. In this deployment, a new version of a ReplicaSet is started alongside the existing ReplicaSet with the old version. The Deployment object launches new pods using the new version of the pod specification, and when the new pods start successfully, shuts down the old pods.  
Rolling updates allow you to migrate between versions in a safe and controlled manner, but the transition to the new version can take time. Also,
 it can be difficult to roll back or interrupt the deployment in the middle if something goes wrong.

11. Blue/Green Deployment (Also Known as Red/Black Deployment)
The downside of a blue/green deployment is that it requires twice the resource utilization, at least during the staging and cut-off period.

12.Canary Deployment
Canary deployments are great for testing new features with small groups of users and can be rolled back easily. Therefore, canary deployment is a good way to determine how new code will affect the system as a whole and whether it will have a positive or negative impact on user experience. 
you also need a service mesh or network gateway to split traffic between current and canary versions.

13.A/B Testing

14. Shadow Deployment

15. Progressive Deployment in Kubernetes with Argo Rollouts
Blue/Green Deployment with Argo Rollouts
Canary Deployment with Argo Rollouts


Let’s update the Nginx Pods to use the nginx:1.16.1 image instead of the nginx:1.14.2 image.

To create deployment
## kubectl create deployment nginx-depl --image=nginx:1.19

create deployment with custom namespace
#kubectl create deployment my-app --image=redis --replicas=2 --namespace dev

To update the Deployment, e.g. update the Nginx image version to 1.21, execute:
## kubectl set image deployment/nginx-depl nginx=nginx:1.21

To scale the Deployment, e.g. create one more replica Pod:
## kubectl scale --replicas=2 deployment/nginx-depl

To Create a Service to expose the Deployment outside the cluster:
## kubectl create service nodeport nginx-depl --tcp=80:80

Delete the Deployment (also deletes the Pods) and the Service:
## kubectl delete deployment nginx-depl
## kubectl delete service nginx-depl

# kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --namespace=default
To create a pod using the nginx image, run the command kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --restart=Never. 
This will create a pod named nginx, running with the nginx image on Docker Hub. And by setting the flag --restart=Never
 we tell Kubernetes to create a single pod rather than a Deployment.
